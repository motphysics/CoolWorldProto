First commit:

preview for now should just display homescreen when files are ran on xcode. 


this is first jank iteration so here is the low down on how to maybe run this preview on your laptop: 
after you create a new xcode project just follow these steps:

1/ copy paste the code from the preview file (or upload it) into new xcode project
2/ drag and drop "newhome.jpeg" file into xcassets folder in the new xcode project
3/ reload the preview, set display for iphone

something similar to the screenshot should display on your computer now.
